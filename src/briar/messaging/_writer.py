"""`MessageWriter` — vendor-neutral write surface.

Symmetric to `TrackerProvider` / `RepositoryProvider` but for outbound
writes instead of reads. Each adapter wraps one vendor's write API
(Jira comment, Slack channel post, Telegram chat message, …).

Strategy + Registry. Adapters live in `messaging/` siblings; the
`WRITERS` registry is built via `build_registry()` so a duplicate
`kind` collision raises at import time.

Two consumers today:
- `briar agent` invokes writers via the `SendMessageTool` (the LLM
  picks a configured channel by name; the tool resolves the channel
  to a writer + calls `send`).
- Future scheduler hooks (deferred) — extract-success notifications,
  status broadcasts.

Each runbook company can declare named writer bindings under
``messages:`` (see `iac/runbook/models.py:MessageBinding`); the
agent picks them up via the company-scoped config injected at run
time."""
